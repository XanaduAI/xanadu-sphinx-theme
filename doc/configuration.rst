.. _configuration:

Configuration
=============

The Xanadu Sphinx Theme supports the following options. These should be added to
the ``html_theme_options`` dictionary in your ``conf.py`` file.

Basic options
-------------

Basic options define the basic look and structure of the theme, including
the project name, logo, and LaTeX macros.

``project_nav_name``
    The name of the project to appear in the left navigation bar,
    under the Xanadu logo.

``project_logo``
    If the project has a logo, set this to the path of the logo
    image file to appear in the left navigation bar,
    under the Xanadu logo. If defined, the project logo
    *replaces* ``project_nav_name``.

``touch_icon``
    Path to the main navigation sidebar Xanadu logo.
    You may find one to use here: :download:`_static/xanadu_logo.png`.

``touch_icon_small``
    Path to the main navigation sidebar small Xanadu logo.
    This is used if the table of contents is large, to save space.
    You may find one to use here: :download:`_static/xanadu_logo_small.png`.

``large_toc``
    If the table of contents is large enough to be scrollable, set
    this option to ``True``.

``disqus_comments_shortname``
    Disqus comment account shortname. If provided, the right hand
    sidebar of each page will contain a scrollable disqus comment box.

``google_analytics_account``:
    Google analytics universal account ID to enable tracking
    and analytics.

``homepage``
    Allow a separate homepage from the standard ``index.html`` Sphinx
    landing page.

``latex_macros``
    Define custom :math:`\LaTeX{}` macros. This is a multiline raw string
    of the form:

    .. code-block:: python

        latex_macros = r"""
        macroname: ['\\text{\#1}', 1],
        anothermacroname: ['\\hat{b}', 0],
        """

    where the second argument in the list is the number of arguments
    the macro takes.

    Note that both the backslash and the # symbol must be escaped.


.. _gallery_options:

Gallery options
---------------

The following options allow Sphinx gallery styling and integration
with the Xanadu theme to be configured.

``gallery_dirs``
    The location of the autogenerated Sphinx gallery documentation.
    This must be the same as the ``sphinx_gallery_conf['gallery_dirs']``
    dictionary value in your Sphinx ``conf.py``.

``github_repo``
    The username/organization name and repository name corresponding
    to the project on GitHub. For example, ``"XanaduAI/xanadu-sphinx-theme"``.


.. _colors:

Style colors
------------

The following options allow the colors of various theme elements
to be altered. These should be fully qualified CSS color specifiers
such as ``#004B6B`` or ``#444``.

``navigation_button`` and ``navigation_button_hover``
    Colors of the 'Next' and 'Previous' navigation buttons located at
    the bottom of every page.

``toc_caption``
    Color of contents captions (denoted by the ``:caption:`` option
    when defining a ``toctree``) in the sidebar table of contents.

``toc_hover``
    Hover color of sidebar links in the table of contents.


``table_header_bg`` and ``table_header_border``
    The background color, and bottom border color, of the ``docstable``
    header.

``logo_hover_bg``
    Background color that should be displayed behind the project logo
    on hover.

``download_button``
    Hover color of the Python script, Jupyter notebook, and GitHub
    download buttons that appear at the top of Sphinx gallery pages.
