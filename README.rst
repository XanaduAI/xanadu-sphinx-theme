The **Xanadu Sphinx Theme** (XST) is a Sphinx theme used for open-source Xanadu
software projects.

A fork of the `Guzzle <https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle_sphinx_theme>`_
Sphinx theme, the theme has the following features:

* *Responsive*. Fluid layout that automatically adjusts for phone, tablet,
  and computer screens.

* *LaTeX Macros*. Comes with built-in support for MathJAX and common predefined
  quantum optics LaTeX macros.

* *Cohesive Design*. Unifies the appearance of all Xanadu Sphinx documentation.

**Details**

    .. code-block:: rest
    
        .. details::
            :title: Usage Details

            In general, the block takes D parameters and **must** have the following signature:

            .. code-block:: python

                unitary(parameter1, parameter2, ... parameterD, wires)

            For a block with multiple parameters, ``n_params_block`` is equal to the number of parameters in ``block``.
            For a block with a single parameter, ``n_params_block`` is equal to the length of the parameter array.
