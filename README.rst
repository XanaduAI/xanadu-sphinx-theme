Xanadu Sphinx theme
###################

The Xanadu Sphinx theme is an open-source Sphinx theme used for Xanadu open-source
Python packages. A fork of the `Guzzle <https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle_sphinx_theme>`_
Sphinx theme, the theme has the following features:


- **Responsive**:

- **Best of both worlds**. Support for **hybrid quantum & classical** models

- **Batteries included**. Provides **optimization and machine learning** tools

- **Device independent**. The same quantum circuit model can be **run on different backends**

- **Large plugin ecosystem**. Install plugins to run your computational circuits on more devices, including Strawberry Fields, Rigetti Forest, ProjectQ, and Qiskit

- **Compatible with existing machine learning libraries**. Quantum circuits can interface with PyTorch, Tensorflow, or NumPy (via autograd), allowing hybrid CPU-GPU-QPU computations.



Installation
============

Xanadu Sphinx Theme requires Python 3. Installation can be done using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python -m pip install xanadu-sphinx-theme


Getting started
===============

For getting started with PennyLane, check out our `qubit rotation <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/qubit_rotation.html>`_, `Gaussian transformation <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/gaussian_transformation.html>`_, `hybrid computation <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/hybrid_computation.html>`_, and other machine learning tutorials.

Our `documentation <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`_ is also a great starting point to familiarize yourself with the hybrid classical-quantum machine learning approach, and explore the available optimization tools provided by PennyLane. Play around with the numerous devices and plugins available for running your hybrid optimizations â€” these include the `IBM QX4 quantum chip <https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/experience>`__, provided by the `PennyLane-PQ <https://github.com/XanaduAI/pennylane-pq>`_ and `PennyLane-qiskit <https://github.com/carstenblank/pennylane-qiskit>`_ plugins, as well as the `Rigetti Aspen-1 QPU <https://www.rigetti.com/qpu>`__.

Finally, detailed documentation on the PennyLane API is provided, for full details on available quantum operations and expectations, and detailed guides on `how to write your own <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/API/overview.html>`_ PennyLane-compatible quantum device.
